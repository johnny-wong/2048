# 2048

Language: Python3
Author: Johnny Wong

## Introduction
A replica of my favourite procrastination tool in 2014.
Customisable board size
Played on cmd terminal. Will need to first import the game2048 file, then initialise the Game class, and run the start_game method.

    >>> import game2048
    >>> game_1 = game2048.Game()
    >>> game_1.start_game()

    Score: 0
